Hello! I am currently a Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where I assist with a variety of research and policy projects related to inequality. I am particulary interested in housing insecurity and early childhood education. 

Before joining the Bank, I served as a 2023-24 Fulbright English Teaching Assistant in Spain and received a BA in Statistics and Computer Science from Harvard College in 2023. In my free time, I enjoy reading memoirs and exploring the expansive New York City food scene.
