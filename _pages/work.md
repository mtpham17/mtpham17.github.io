## Early Childhood Education

### Senior Thesis: [The Importance of Random Effects in Variable Selection](/files/PhamThu_Thesis.pdf) (April 2023)

I wrote a thesis on the role that random effects may play in variable selection. Specifically, I examined this phenomenon in an early childhood case study. You can find my code [here](https://github.com/mtpham17/thesis).

### Collaboration with Early Learning Studies at Harvard (September 2022)

I wrote code to wrangle early childhood data for a [conference paper](https://sree.confex.com/sree/2022/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/4080).

## My Work at the Bank

### Economic Heterogeneity Indicators (July 2024 - Present)

At the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, I work in the Microeconomics Department, where I am the main Research Analyst responsible for maintaining and analyzing the [Economic Heterogeneity Indicators](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/economic-heterogeneity-indicators). These measure macroeconomic disparities in differential inflation, employment outcomes, and wealth across different demographics in the United States and the Second Federal Reserve District.
