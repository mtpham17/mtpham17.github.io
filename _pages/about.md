Hello! I am currently a Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where I assist with a variety of research and policy projects related to inequality. I am particularly interested in housing insecurity and early childhood education. 

Before joining the Bank, I served as a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant in Spain and received a BA in Statistics and Computer Science from Harvard College. In my free time, I enjoy trying to recreate my grandma's cooking, playing word games, and singing in my church's choir.
