Hello! My name is Thu, and I am currently a Research Analyst in the Equitable Growth Studies department at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I graduated from Harvard College in 2023 with a BA in Statistics and Computer Science. Before joining the Bank, I served as a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant in La Rioja, Spain.

At the Bank, I assist in the maintenance and analysis of the [Equitable Growth Indicators](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/equitable-growth-indicators), which highlight macroeconomic disparities across different demographics. I also provide research assistance to my economists on applied micreconomic projects that broadly fit under the umbrella of inequality, such as household debt and the impact of remote work.

My interests lie in early childhood education and housing, and I am passionate about applying my technical skills towards helping vulnerable populations affected by these issues. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring the expansive NYC food scene, playing volleyball, and reading biographies and memoirs.
